    "## Notebook Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook builds upon the feature-engineered dataset from the previous notebook (`04_feature_engineering.ipynb`) and focuses on **Model Training and Evaluation**. Our primary goal is to develop a credit risk prediction model that excels at identifying potential loan defaulters, thereby minimizing financial losses for retail banks while also considering their desired balance between risk aversion and loan approval rates. This translates to maximizing the recall of the positive class (loan defaulters) while maintaining acceptable precision and overall model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 0.5.1 Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "The main objectives of this notebook are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Model Selection:** Choose algorithms suitable for imbalanced classification problems.\n",
    "2. **Model Training:** Train models with a focus on identifying potential defaulters.\n",
    "3. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimize models to increase recall for the positive class.\n",
    "4. **Model Evaluation:** Assess models primarily on recall, while considering precision, F2-score, AUC-PR, and overall performance.\n",
    "5. **Model Comparison:** Compare different models based on their ability to identify true positives and balance the precision-recall trade-off.\n",
    "6. **Threshold Adjustment:** Explore the impact of classification thresholds on recall and precision, collaborating with retail banks to determine the optimal threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 0.5.2 Importance of Focusing on Recall\n",
    "\n",
    "Prioritizing recall for defaulter prediction is crucial for minimizing financial losses, which is the primary business objective in credit risk assessment. The cost of missing a potential defaulter (false negative) is typically much higher than the cost of incorrectly classifying a non-defaulter as high-risk (false positive). While we prioritize recall, we will also carefully consider the precision-recall trade-off and aim for a model that maximizes recall without severely impacting precision. Techniques like threshold adjustment and cost-sensitive learning will be used to balance these metrics effectively. Furthermore, demonstrating a thorough approach to risk identification aligns with regulatory expectations in the financial sector, supporting the banks' compliance needs. This approach also allows for more conservative lending practices, which can be adjusted based on the bank's specific risk tolerance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 0.5.3 Our Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will focus on the following modeling tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Preparation:** Address class imbalance using techniques like SMOTE or class weighting.\n",
    "2. **Baseline Model:** A logistic regression model with class weights inversely proportional to class frequencies will serve as our baseline. This will provide a benchmark for evaluating more complex models.\n",
    "3. **Advanced Models:** Train and evaluate models known for handling imbalanced data:\n",
    "   - Decision Trees with adjusted class weights\n",
    "   - Random Forest with balanced class weights\n",
    "   - Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM) with `scale_pos_weight` adjustment\n",
    "4. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** We will employ techniques like GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV, optimizing for the F2-score (which gives more weight to recall) or a custom cost-sensitive scoring function.\n",
    "5. **Model Evaluation:** Prioritize recall in our metrics, while also considering precision, F2-score, AUC-PR, and AUC-ROC.\n",
    "6. **Threshold Adjustment:** We will experiment with different classification thresholds and work closely with retail banks to determine the optimal threshold that balances their desired level of risk aversion with acceptable loan approval rates.\n",
    "7. **Ensemble Methods:** Explore ensemble techniques that can improve recall without severely impacting precision.\n",
    "8. **Cost-Sensitive Learning:** Incorporate misclassification costs to reflect the higher cost of false negatives, aligning the model's objective with the business goal of minimizing financial losses.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, we aim to have a model (or ensemble of models) that excels at identifying potential loan defaulters, providing the bank with a powerful tool for risk assessment and mitigation.\n"
