    "## **Notebook Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **0.2.1 Project Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook builds upon the preprocessed data from the previous notebook (`01_data_loading_and_preprocessing.ipynb`) and focuses on feature selection, data preparation, and outlier handling. These steps involve refining the dataset by selecting the most relevant features, handling outliers by flagging them, and preparing the data for machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **0.2.2 Why is This Important?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Effective feature selection and data preparation are critical to the success of machine learning projects. By reducing the dataset's complexity and addressing data quality issues such as missing values, outliers, and duplicates, we can improve model performance, interpretability, and generalization. Handling outliers is particularly important as they can skew predictions, and flagging them preserves potentially valuable information without directly altering the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **0.2.3 Dataset Description**\n",
    "\n",
    "We are continuing to work with the Home Credit dataset, which contains loan application data. This dataset includes a variety of features related to applicant demographics, financial history, and loan specifics. The data has already been cleaned and memory-optimized in the previous notebook. Now, we focus on feature reduction, outlier handling, and imputation of missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **0.2.4 Our Approach**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will employ several techniques for feature selection, outlier handling, and data preparation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Missing Value Imputation:** We will use KNN imputation for numerical features and mode imputation for categorical features to handle missing data.\n",
    "2. **Outlier Detection and Flagging:** We will identify outliers using statistical methods such as IQR or Z-scores and flag them by adding a binary feature to indicate the presence of outliers.\n",
    "3. **Feature Reduction:** We will remove features with high percentages of missing values, low variance, or low correlation with the target variable, while ensuring essential features are retained.\n",
    "4. **Duplicate Removal:** We will identify and remove duplicate rows to maintain data integrity.\n",
    "5. **Save Preprocessed Data:** Save the prepared datasets in Parquet format for use in subsequent notebooks (EDA and modeling).\n"

    "**To improve our training and testing datasets, we will remove features based on missing values, variance, and correlation. Features with a missing value ratio above `missing_threshold` (30%) or a variance below `variance_threshold` will be removed.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Columns with a variance less than or equal to 0.01 are considered to have insufficient variability and are removed from the dataset. This is because a variance of 0.01 implies very little change in the values of that feature, making it potentially less useful for distinguishing between different observations in predictive modeling tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we'll calculate the correlation between numerical features and the target variable (`target`). **We recognize the importance of income in credit risk assessment, so the `amt_income_total` feature will always be retained regardless of its correlation with the target.** Other features that show a low correlation with the target (absolute correlation value below the specified `correlation_threshold` - default 0.05) will be removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**This entire feature reduction process will be applied separately to the training and testing datasets. While the criteria (missing value, variance, and correlation thresholds) are determined from the training data, we'll use the same set of selected features to reduce both the training and test datasets.** This ensures consistency in our feature sets and prevents data leakage from the test set into the feature selection process.\n",
    "\n",
