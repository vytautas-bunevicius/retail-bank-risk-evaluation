    "## Home Credit Default Risk Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to develop multiple machine learning models to predict the likelihood of loan default for Home Credit Group clients. As a proof-of-concept (POC) for our startup's risk evaluation service, we'll create a suite of models that can help banks make more informed decisions about loan approvals. Our goal is to maximize accuracy in identifying both creditworthy clients and potential defaults, providing a robust and flexible solution for our potential banking clients.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is this Important?\n",
    "\n",
    "Home Credit specializes in lending to individuals with limited or no credit history (often referred to as \"unbanked\" or \"underbanked\"). They utilize diverse data sources, including phone and transaction data, to assess loan repayment probability. By developing accurate default prediction models, we can:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Expand financial inclusion:** Enable deserving clients who might be rejected by traditional methods to access credit.\n",
    "- **Optimize risk management:** Help financial institutions make more informed lending decisions, reducing their exposure to potential losses.\n",
    "- **Demonstrate our startup's capabilities:** Showcase our ability to translate complex business requirements into effective machine learning solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset Description\n",
    "\n",
    "We're using the Home Credit Default Risk dataset, which includes comprehensive information about loan applications and borrowers' credit histories. The data is structured across several interconnected tables:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Application Data (`application_{train|test}.csv`):** The primary table containing loan application details such as age, income, employment history, etc.\n",
    "2. **Bureau Data (`bureau.csv` and `bureau_balance.csv`):** Information about the applicants' previous loans from other financial institutions.\n",
    "3. **Previous Applications (`previous_application.csv`):** Historical data on the applicants' past loan applications with Home Credit.\n",
    "4. **Home Credit Loan Details:**\n",
    "   - **POS and Cash Loans Balance (`pos_cash_balance.csv`):** Monthly balance snapshots of previous point-of-sale and cash loans.\n",
    "   - **Credit Card Balance (`credit_card_balance.csv`):** Monthly balance snapshots of previous credit cards.\n",
    "5. **Installments Payments (`installments_payments.csv`):** Payment history for previous loans at Home Credit.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Our Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use a comprehensive, multi-stage approach to develop our predictive models:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initial Data Exploration:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Conduct thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on each table.\n",
    "   - Identify key variables and their distributions.\n",
    "   - Investigate relationships between features and the target variable (loan default).\n",
    "   - Check for data quality issues, missing values, and anomalies.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Feature Engineering and Data Preprocessing:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Create new features based on domain knowledge and initial insights.\n",
    "   - Handle missing data and outliers.\n",
    "   - Perform appropriate encoding for categorical variables and scaling for numerical features.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Statistical Inference:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Define the target population and formulate multiple statistical hypotheses.\n",
    "   - Construct confidence intervals and conduct appropriate statistical tests.\n",
    "   - Analyze correlations and other relationships between variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Model Development:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Implement multiple machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting).\n",
    "   - Utilize cross-validation techniques to ensure model robustness.\n",
    "   - Perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Model Evaluation and Selection:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Assess models using appropriate performance metrics (e.g., AUC-ROC, precision, recall).\n",
    "   - Analyze feature importance and model interpretability.\n",
    "   - Select the best-performing models for deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Model Deployment:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Deploy the top-performing models to Google Cloud Platform.\n",
    "   - Ensure models are accessible via HTTP requests for easy integration.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Documentation and Presentation:**\n",
    "   - Clearly document all steps, assumptions, and results.\n",
    "   - Prepare visualizations and explanations of our findings.\n",
    "   - Develop recommendations for potential clients based on our insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Source:** The dataset is from the [Home Credit Default Risk Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/home-credit-default-risk/data).\n",
    "- **Geographic Scope:** Home Credit operates primarily in CIS and Southeast Asian countries, including Kazakhstan, Russia, Vietnam, China, Indonesia, and the Philippines.\n",
    "- **Product Categories:** Home Credit offers various loan products:\n",
    "  - Revolving loans (credit cards)\n",
    "  - Consumer loans (point-of-sale or POS loans)\n",
    "  - Cash loans\n",
    "- **Ethical Considerations:** We'll pay close attention to potential biases in our models and strive for fair lending practices.\n",
    "- **Iterative Process:** Our approach will be flexible, allowing for iterations and refinements based on insights gained throughout the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Home Credit Dataset Schema:**\n",
    "\n",
    "![Home Credit Dataset Schema](../images/data-scheme.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This project will demonstrate our ability to handle complex, real-world data and deliver valuable insights and predictive capabilities to the financial sector.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this project, we aim to provide Home Credit with a reliable and easy-to-use tool to predict loan default risk, allowing them to make better lending decisions and potentially extend credit to more people who can manage it responsibly.\n"
