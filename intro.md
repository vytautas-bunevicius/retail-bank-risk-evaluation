   ## Project Overview

   This project aims to evaluate and assess risk factors in retail banking using data analysis and machine learning techniques. Throughout this book, we'll walk through the process of loading and preprocessing data, selecting relevant features, conducting exploratory data analysis, engineering new features, and training and evaluating predictive models.

   Let's begin our journey into retail bank risk evaluation!
